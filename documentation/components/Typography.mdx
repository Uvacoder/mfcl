### Pass a Custom Tag to the Component
You may want the xxl variant, but you already have an h1 on the page, 
so you're able to pass a tag with the tag prop. 

- For example, turn an xl variant, which is an h2, into a p tag. 

<Playground>
  <Typography variant='xxl' tag='p'>
    This is the xxl variant but rendered as a p tag instead!
  </Typography>
  <Typography variant='priceSale' tag='a' href='/'>
    This is the priceSale variant but rendered as an a tag instead!
  </Typography>
  <Typography variant='bodyLg' tag='h3' className='veryGreen' style={{color: 'green'}}>
    This is the bodyLg variant but rendered as an h3 tag instead! Also with a custom className and styling.
  </Typography>
</Playground>
